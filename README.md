## **Examples**
Here are some examples of what you can learn in this repository:

1. **Reading and Writing Files:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Read CSV file
   df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

   # Write DataFrame to CSV
   df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
   ```

2. **Filtering Data:**
   ```python
   # Filter rows where column 'A' is greater than 10
   filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 10]
   ```

3. **GroupBy Example:**
   ```python
   # Group data by column 'B' and calculate the mean of 'A'
   grouped = df.groupby('B')['A'].mean()
   ```
